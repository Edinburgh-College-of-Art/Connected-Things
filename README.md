# Contents
## ThingSpeak
Code related to connecting to communicating with ThingSpeak. Make sure to download the ThingSpeak library in the Arduino IDE

## Web Server
Code relating to setting the Feather M0 as web server, serving html webpages and providing a wireless access point.

## Timer Interrupts
Code demonstrating how to use the timers available on the Feather M0. This differs from the approach you would take if using an Arduino Uno, but the code has been structured in such a way that you shouldn't have to worry to much about what is happening under-the-hood. Timer interrupts are used to make actions happen at regular intervals. This means that you won't be able to use the `delay()` function.
Download the Adafruit ZeroTimer Library for greater control.
